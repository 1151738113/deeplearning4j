Here's where you can ask questions and contribute your knowledge:

* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deeplearning4j)

### license

Deeplearning4j is distributed under an Apache 2.0 license, the most permissive license we're aware of. 

###roadmap

We're looking for contributors to help on a number of fronts. 

We're planning to add recurrent neural nets, although they're well implemented elsewhere. A Python SDK is planned, as is Spark integration. 

For those of you who'd like to bring deep-learning applications to a much wider set of users, we can use help with documentation and tutorials. This site is open source and we accept pull requests (just look on the gh-pages branch).

Adam is prototyping up-to-date tutorials in the [Deeplearning4j examples subproject](https://github.com/agibsonccc/java-deeplearning/tree/master/deeplearning4j-examples).
