Here's where you can ask questions and contribute your knowledge:

*  [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deeplearning4j)

###roadmap

We're looking for contributors to help on a number of fronts. 

The deep autoencoder is in its final trial, and will soon have its own page here. Convolutional nets are 90 percent done -- we just need to build the front end to load the data in.  Recursive neural tensor networks will be the next stop, and we're hoping to add RNNs. 

The big project later this year will be integrating with GPUs. Some of these will be hard (but not impossible) nuts to crack and help is welcome. 

For those of you who'd like to bring deep-learning applications to a much wider set of users, we can use help with documentation and tutorials. This site is open source and we accept pull requests (just look on the gh-pages branch).

Adam is prototyping up-to-date tutorials in the [Deeplearning4j examples subproject](https://github.com/agibsonccc/java-deeplearning/tree/master/deeplearning4j-examples).
