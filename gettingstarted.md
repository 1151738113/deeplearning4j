# Getting Started

This is a multistep install. We highly recommend you join our [Gitter Live Chat](https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j) if you have questions or feedback, so we can walk you through it. If you're feeling anti-social or brashly independent, you're still invited to lurk and learn. 

The prerequisites installs for Deeplearning4j are documented on the ["Getting Started" page](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html) of ND4J, the linear algebra engine powering DL4J's neural nets:

1. [Java 7 or above](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#java) 
2. [Integrated Development Environment: IntelliJ](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#ide-for-java) 
3. [Maven](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#maven)
5. [GitHub](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#github)

After those installs, please read the following:

6. OS-specific instructions
    * <a href="#linux">Linux</a>
    * <a href="#osx">OSX</a>
    * <a href="#windows">Windows</a>
7. <a href="#one">Magical One-Line Install</a>
8. <a href="#source">Working With Source</a>
9. <a href="#eclipse">Eclipse</a>
10. <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a>
11. <a href="#results">Reproducible Results</a>
12. <a href="#next">Next Steps</a>

### <a name="linux">Linux</a>

* Due to our reliance on Jblas for CPUs, native bindings for Blas are required.

        Fedora/RHEL
        yum -y install blas

        Ubuntu
        apt-get install libblas* (credit to @sujitpal)

* If GPUs are broken, you'll need to enter an extra command. First, find out where Cuda installs itself. It will look something like this

         /usr/local/cuda/lib64

Then enter *ldconfig* in the terminal, followed by the file path to link Cuda. Your command will look similar to this

         ldconfig /usr/local/cuda/lib64

If you're still unable to load Jcublas, you will need to add the parameter -D to your code (it's a JVM argument):

         java.library.path (settable via -Djava.librarypath=...) 
         // ^ for a writable directory, then 
         -D appended directly to "<OTHER ARGS>" 

If you're using IntelliJ as your IDE, this should work already. 

### <a name="osx">OSX</a>

* Jblas is already installed on OSX.  

### <a name="windows">Windows</a>

* While our Windows install is not always easy, Deeplearning4j is one of the few open-source deep learning projects that actually cares about trying to support the Windows community. Please see the [Windows section of our ND4J page](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#windows) for more instructions. 

* Install [MinGW 32 bits](http://www.mingw.org/) even if you have a 64-bit computer (the download button is on the upper right), and then download the [Prebuilt dynamic libraries using Mingw](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/#libraries_mingw). 

* Install [Lapack](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/). (Lapack will ask if you have Intel compilers. You do not.)

* Lapack offers the alternative of [VS Studio Solution](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/#lapacke). You'll also want to look at the documentation for [Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)](http://www.netlib.org/blas/). 

* Alternatively, you can bypass MinGW and copy the Blas dll files to a folder in your PATH. For example, the path to the MinGW bin folder is: /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin. To read more about the PATH variable in Windows, please read the [top answer on this StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402214/windows-7-maven-2-install). 

* Cygwin is not supported. You must install DL4J from **DOS Windows**.  

### <a name="one">Magical One-Line Install</a>

For users who have never `git cloned` Deeplearning4j before, you should be able to install the framework, along with ND4J and Canova, by entering one line in your command prompt:

      git clone https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/; cd deeplearning4j;./setup.sh

### <a name="source">Working With Source</a>

To work with source, you need to install a [project Lombok plugin](https://projectlombok.org/download.html) for IntelliJ or Eclipse.

Our [Github repo is here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/). Install Github for [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [Windows](https://windows.github.com/). Then *git clone* the repository, and run this command for Maven:

      mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

If you want to run Deeplearning4j examples after installing from trunk, you should *git clone* ND4J, Canova and Deeplearning4j, in that order, and then install all from source using Maven with this command:

      mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

Following these steps, you should be able to run the 0.0.3.3 examples. 

If you have an existing project, you can build Deeplearning4j's source files yourself and then add dependencies as JAR files to your project. Each dependency used with Deeplearning4j and [ND4J](http://nd4j.org/dependencies.html) can be included in your project's POM.xml as a jar like this, specifying the most recent version of ND4J or Deeplearning4j between the `properties` tags. 

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>deeplearning4j-ui</artifactId>
            <version>${dl4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>deeplearning4j-ui</artifactId>
            <version>${dl4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>deeplearning4j-nlp</artifactId>
            <version>${dl4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>

###<a name="eclipse">Eclipse</a> 

After running a *git clone*, enter this command

      mvn eclipse:eclipse 
  
which will import the source and set everything up. 

After many years using Eclipse, we recommend IntelliJ, which has a similar interface. Eclipse's monolithic architecture has a tendency to cause strange errors in our code and others'. 

If you use Eclipse, you will need to install the [Lombok plugin](https://projectlombok.org/). 

### <a name="trouble">Troubleshooting</a>

* Please feel free to ask us about error messages on our [Gitter Live Chat](https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j). When you post your question, please have the following information ready (it will really speed things up!):

      * Operating System (Windows, OSX, Linux) and version 
      * Java version (7, 8) : type java -version in your terminal/CMD
      * Maven version : type mvn --version in your terminal/CMD
      * Stacktrace: Please past the error code on Gist and share the link with us: [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)
* If you have installed DL4J before and now see the examples throwing errors, run a `git clone` on [ND4J](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html), Canova and DL4J and a `mvn clean install -Dskiptests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true` within all three directories, in that order.
* When you run an example, you may get a low [f1 score](../glossary.html#f1), which is the probability that the net's classification is accurate. In this case, a low f1 doesn't indicate poor performance, because the examples train on small data sets. We gave them small data sets so they would run quickly. Because small data sets are less representative than large ones, the results they produce will vary a great deal. For example, on the minuscule example data, our deep-belief net's f1 score currently varies between 0.32 and 1.0. 
* Deeplearning4j includes an **autocomplete function**. If you are unsure which commands are available, press any letter and a drop-down list like this will appear:
![Alt text](../img/dl4j_autocomplete.png)
* Here's the **Javadoc** for all [Deeplearning4j's classes and methods](http://deeplearning4j.org/doc/).
* As the code base grows, installing from source requires more memory. If you encounter a `Permgen error` during the DL4J build, you may need to add more **heap space**. To do that, you'll need to find and alter your hidden `.bash_profile` file, which adds environmental variables to bash. To see those variables, enter `env` in the command line. To add more heap space, enter this command in your console:
      echo "export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"" > ~/.bash_profile
* Older versions of Maven, such as 3.0.4, are likely to throw exceptions like a NoSuchMethodError. This can be fixed by upgrading to the latest version of Maven, which is currently 3.3.x. To check your Maven version, enter `mvn -v` in the command line.
* After you install Maven, you may receive a message like this: `mvn is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` That means you need Maven in your [PATH variable](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml), which you can change like any other environmental variable.  
* If you see the error `Invalid JDK version in profile 'java8-and-higher': Unbounded range: [1.8, for project com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-core com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-core:jar:1.3.0`, you may have a Maven issue. Please update to version 3.3.x.
* To compile some ND4J dependencies, you need to install some **dev tools** for C and C++. [Please see our ND4J guide](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#devtools).
* The include path for [Java CPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) doesn't always work on **Windows**. One workaround is to take the the header files from the include directory of Visual Studio, and put them in the include directory of the Java Run-Time Environment (JRE), where Java is installed. This will affect files such as standardio.h. More information is available [here](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#windows). 
* Instructions on monitoring your GPUs are [here](http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#gpu).
* One major reason to use Java is its pre-baked diagnostics in the **[JVisualVM](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jvisualvm.html)**. If you have Java installed, just enter `jvisualvm` in your command line and you'll get visuals on your CPU, Heap, PermGen, Classes and Threads. One useful view: Click on the `Sampler` tab on the upper right, and then select the CPU or Memory button for visuals. 
![Alt text](../img/jvisualvm.png)
* Some problems encountered using DL4J may be due to a lack of familiarity with the ideas and techniques of machine learning. We strongly encourage all Deeplearning4j users to rely on resources beyond this website to understand the fundamentals. We've included a list of educational resources for machine and deep learning on [this page](../deeplearningpapers.html). While we've partially documented DL4J, parts of the code essentially remain a raw, domain-specific language for deep learning.
* When using `deeplearning4j-nlp` from a **Clojure** application and building an uberjar with Leiningen, it is necessary to specify the following in the `project.clj` so that the akka `reference.conf` resource files are properly merged. `:uberjar-merge-with {#"\.properties$" [slurp str spit] "reference.conf" [slurp str spit]}`. Note that the first entry in the map for .properties files is the usual default). If this is not done, the following exception will be thrown when trying to run from the resulting uberjar: `Exception in thread "main" com.typesafe.config.ConfigException$Missing: No configuration setting found for key 'akka.version'`.

### <a name="results">Reproducible Results</a>

Neural net weights are initialized randomly, which means the model begins learning from a different position in the weight space each time, which may lead it to different local optima. Users seeking reproducible results will need to use the same random weights, which they must initialize before the model is created. They can reinitialize with the same random weight with this line:

      Nd4j.getRandom().setSeed(123);
