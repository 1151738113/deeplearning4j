# what is deeplearning4j?

Deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade deep-learning library for Java. It is meant to be used in business environments, rather than as a research tool for extensive data exploration. 
Deeplearning4j is most helpful in solving distinct problems (like identifying cat faces). 

Deeplearning4j aims to be cutting-edge plug and play, more convention than configuration. By following its conventions, you get an infinitely scalable deep-learning architecture. It's made for data input and neural net training at scale, and its output should be highly compact and accurate predictive models. Trained correctly, these neural nets are more than 95 percent accurate; i.e. equal to or better than human perception.

By following the links at the bottom of each page, you will learn to set up, and train with sample data, several types of deep-learning networks. These include single- and multithread networks, [Restricted Boltzmann machines](../restrictedboltzmannmachine.html), [deep-belief networks](../deepbeliefnetwork.html) and [Stacked Denoising Autoencoders](../stackeddenoisingautoencoder.html).
