# Tutorials

## Basic Neural Networks

### MNIST for Beginners

MNIST is the "Hello World" of machine learning. With this tutorial, you can train on MNIST with a single-layer neural network.

[View example](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/mnist/MLPMnistSingleLayerExample.java)

### MNIST for Experts

By applying a more complex algorithm, Lenet, to MNIST, you can achieve 99 percent accuracy. Lenet is a deep convolutional network.

### Linear Classifier Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how a multilayer perceptron can be used as a linear classifier.

### XOR Tutorial

XOR is a digital logic gate that implements an exclusive or. XOR means that a true output, or an output of 1, results if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is true.
