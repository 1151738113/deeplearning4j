#How to Run Any DL4J Example

Java involves deep and complex file systems, which you'll need to work with to run examples. 

		git clone https://github.com/SkymindIO/dl4j-examples

Once you've cloned the repos, you'll need to load the dl4j-examples into IntelliJ as a project. With that, you can run any example it contains. The MNIST example is where most DL4J users start (to learn more about MNIST, go [here](../mnist-tutorial.html)).

Windows with graphs and numeral-image reconstructions should pop up if Numpy is working properly. The graphs' x-axis is narrow, but if they display normal (bell-curve-shaped) distributions, your net is training well.
