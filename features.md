# features

Here's a non-exhaustive list of Deeplearning4j's features. We'll be updating it as new nets and tools are added. 

### nets

* [Restricted Boltzman machines](../restrictedboltzmannmachine.html)
* [Deep-belief networks](../deepbeliefnetwork.html)
* [Denoising and Stacked Denoising autoencoders](../denoisingautoencoder.html)
* [Deep autoencoders](../deepautoencoder.html)

*Coming soon*

* [Convolutional deep-belief networks](../convolutionalnets.html)
* [Recursive neural tensor networks](http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/)

### tools

DL4J contains the following built-in vectorization algorithms:

* Moving-window for images
* Moving-window for text 
* Viterbi for sequential classification
* Word2Vec
* Bag-of-Words encoding for word count and TF-IDF

*Coming soon*

* Dependency parsing

DL4J supports two kinds of back propagation:

* Normal stochastic gradient descent
* Conjugate gradient line search (cf Hinton 2006)

### knobs

* Dropout
* Sparsity
* Adagrad
* L2 regularization

### loss/objective functions

* Reconstruction entropy
* Squared loss
* MC class cross entropy for classification
* momentum
