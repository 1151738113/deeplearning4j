#MNIST for Beginners

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’ll classify the MNIST dataset, the “Hello World” of machine learning.

MNIST is a database containing images of handwritten digits, with each image labeled by integer. It is used to benchmark the performance 
of machine learning algorithms. Deep learning performs quite well on MNIST, achieving more than 99.7% accuracy. 

We will use MNIST to train a neural network to look at each image and predict the digit. The first step is to install Deeplearning4j.
