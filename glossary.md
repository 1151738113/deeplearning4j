# Deep Learning and Neural Network Glossary

### <a name="activation">Activation</a> 
An activation for a neural network is defined as the mapping of the input to the output via a [non-linear transform function](#nonlineartransformfunction) at each "node", which is simply a locus of computation within the net. Each layer in a neural net consists of many nodes. Activation algorithms are the gates that determine, at each node in the net, whether and to what extent to transmit the signal the node has received from the previous layer. A combination of coefficients and biases work on the input data from the previous layer to determine whether that signal surpasses a given treshhold and is deemed significant. Those weights and biases are slowly altered as the neural net minimizes its error; i.e. nodes' activations change with learning. Deeplearning4j includes activation functions such as sigmoid, relu, tanh and ELU. 

### <a name="attention">Attention Models</a> 

Attention models "attend" to specific parts of an image in sequence, one after another. By relying on a sequence of glances, they capture visual structure, much like the human eye is believed to function with foveation. This visual processing, which relies on a recurrent network to process sequential data, can be contrasted with other machine vision techniques that process a whole image in a single, forward pass. See also [DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623).

### <a name="backprop">Backpropagation</a> 
To calculate the [gradient](#gradient) the relate weights to error, we use a technique known as backpropagation, which is also referred to as the backward pass of the network. Backpropagation is a repeated application of chain rule of calculus for partial
derivatives. The first step is to calculate the derivatives of the objective function with respect to the output units, then the derivatives of the output of the last hidden layer to the input of the last hidden layer; then the input of the last hidden layer to the weights between it and the penultimate hidden layer, etc. Here's a [derivation of backpropagation](http://web.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs81/s10/BackPropDeriv.pdf). And here's [Yann LeCun's important paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-88.pdf) on the subject.

###<a name="binarization">Binarization</a> 
The process of transforming data in to a set of zeros and ones. An example would be gray-scaling an image by transforming a picture from the 0-255 spectrum to a 0-1 spectrum. 

###<a name="boltzmann">Boltzmann Machine</a> 
"A Boltzmann machine learns internal (not defined by the user) concepts that help to explain (that can generate) the observed data. These concepts are captured by random variables (called hidden units) that have a joint distribution (statistical dependencies) among themselves and with the data, and that allow the learner to capture highly non-linear and complex interactions between the parts (observed random variables) of any observed example (like the pixels in an image). You can also think of these higher-level factors or hidden units as another, more abstract, representation of the data. The Boltzmann machine is parametrized through simple two-way interactions between every pair of random variable involved (the observed ones as well as the hidden ones)." - [Yoshua Bengio](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-a-Boltzmann-machine)

### <a name="confusionmatrix">Confusion Matrix</a>
Also known as an error matrix or contingency table. Confusions matrices allow you to see if your algorithm is systematically confusing two labels, by contrasting your net's predictions against a benchmark.

### <a name="contrastivedivergence">Contrastive Divergence</a>
"[Contrastive divergence](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~ojw/files/NotesOnCD.pdf) is a recipe for training undirected [graphical models](#graphicalmodels) (a class of probabilistic models used in machine learning). It relies on an approximation of the [gradient](#gradient) (a good direction of change for the parameters) of the [log-likelihood](#loglikelihood) (the basic criterion that most probabilistic learning algorithms try to optimize) based on a short Markov chain (a way to sample from probabilistic models) started at the last example seen. It has been popularized in the context of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006, Science), the latter being the first and most popular building block for deep learning algorithms." ~[*Yoshua Bengio*](http://www.quora.com/What-is-contrastive-divergence)

### <a name="cosine">Cosine Similarity</a>

It turns out two vectors are just 66% of a triangle, so let's do a quick trig review. 

Trigonometric functions like *sine*, *cosine* and *tangent* are ratios that use the lengths of a side of a right triangle (opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse) to compute the shapeâ€™s angles. By feeding the sides into ratios like these 

![Alt text](../img/trig_functions2.png)

we can also know the angles at which those sides intersect. Remember [SOH-CAH-TOA](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SOHCAHTOA.html)?

Differences between word vectors, as they swing around the origin like the arms of a clock, can be thought of as differences in degrees. 

And similar to ancient navigators gauging the stars by a sextant, we will measure the *angular distance* between words using something called *cosine similarity*. You can think of words as points of light in a dark canopy, clustered together in constellations of meaning. 

![Alt text](../img/angular_dist_cosine.png)

To find that distance knowing only the word vectors, we need the equation for vector dot multiplication (multiplying two vectors to produce a single, scalar value). 

![Alt text](../img/colored_dot_product.png)

In Java, you can think of the formula to measure cosine similarity like this:

    public static double cosineSimilarity(double[] vectorA, double[] vectorB) {
        double dotProduct = 0.0;
        double normA = 0.0;
        double normB = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < vectorA.length; i++) {
            dotProduct += vectorA[i] * vectorB[i];
            normA += Math.pow(vectorA[i], 2);
            normB += Math.pow(vectorB[i], 2);
        }   
        return dotProduct / (Math.sqrt(normA) * Math.sqrt(normB));
    }

Cosine is the angle attached to the origin, which makes it useful here. (We normalize the measurements so they come out as percentages, where 1 means that two vectors are equal, and 0 means they are perpendicular, bearing no relation to each other.) 

### <a name="deeplearning">Deep Learning</a>

    Deep Learning allows computational models composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.  These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection, and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large datasets by using the back-propagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.  Deep convolutional nets have brought about dramatic improvements in processing images, video, speech and audio, while recurrent nets have shone on sequential data such as text and speech.  Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep learning methods are representation learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.

### <a name="distributed">Distributed Representations</a>

The Nupic community has a good explanation of distributed representations [here](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Sparse-Distributed-Representations). Other good explanations can be found on this [Quora page](https://www.quora.com/Deep-Learning/What-is-meant-by-a-distributed-representation).

### <a name="downpoursgd">Downpour Stochastic Gradient Descent</a>
[Downpour stochastic gradient descent](http://research.google.com/archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.html) is an asynchronous [stochastic gradient descent](#stochasticgradientdescent) procedure, employed by Google among others, that expands the scale and increases the speed of training deep-learning networks. 

###<a name="epoch">Epoch vs Iteration</a>

In machine-learning parlance, an epoch is a complete pass through a given dataset. That is, by the end of one epoch, your neural network -- be it a restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional net or deep-belief network -- will have been exposed to every record to example within the dataset once. Not to be confused with an iteration, which is simply one update of the neural net model's parameters. Many iterations can occur before an epoch is over. Epoch and iteration are only synonymous if you update your parameters once for each pass through the whole dataset; if you update using mini-batches, they mean different things. Say your data has 2 minibatches: A and B. `.numIterations(3)` performs training like AAABBB, while 3 epochs looks like ABABAB.

###<a name="etl">ETL</a>
Extract, transform, load: Data is loaded from disk or other sources into memory with the proper transforms such as [binarization](#binarization) and [normalization](#normalization). Broadly, you can think of a datapipeline as the process over gathering data from disparate sources and locations, putting it into a form that your algorithms can learn from, and then placing it in a data structure that they can iterate through. 

###<a name="f1">f1 Score</a>
The f1 score is a number between zero and one that explains how well the network performed during training. It is analogous to a percentage, with 1 being the best score and zero the worst. f1 is basically the probability that your netâ€™s guesses are correct.

    F1 = 2 * ((precision * recall) / (precision + recall))

Accuracy measures how often you get the right answer, while f1 scores are a measure of accuracy. For example, if you have 100 fruit -- 99 apples and 1 orange -- and your model predicts that all 100 items are apples, then it is 99% accurate. But that model failed to identify the difference between apples and oranges. f1 scores help you judge whether a model is actually doing well as classifying when you have an imbalance in the categories you're trying to tag.

An f1 score is an average of both precision and recall. More specifically, it is a type of average called the harmonic mean, which tends to be less than the arithmetic or geometric means. Recall answers: "Given a positive example, how likely is the classifier going to detect it?" It is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Precision answers: "Given a positive prediction from the classifier, how likely is it to be correct ?" It is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

For f1 to be high, both recall and precision of the model have to be high.

### <a name="feedforwardneuralnetwork">Feed-Forward Network</a>
A neural network that takes the initial input and triggers the [activation](#activation) of each layer of the network successively, without circulating. Feed-forward nets contrast with recurrent and recursive nets in that feed-forward nets never let the output of one node circle back to the same or previous nodes.

### <a name="gaussian">Gaussian Distribution</a>
A Gaussian, or [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that represents the probability that any given observation will occur on different points of a range. Visually, it resembles what's usually called a Bell curve. 

### <a name="gradient">Gradient Descent</a>
Gradient is another word for the rate of change of a neural net as it learns how to reconstruct a dataset. The process of minimizing error is called [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent). Gradient is synonymous with the idea of a derivative in [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus).

        Since MLPs are, by construction, differentiable operators, they can be trained to minimise any differentiable objective function using gradient descent. The basic idea of gradient descent is to find the derivative of the objective function with respect to each of the network weights, then adjust the weights in the direction of the negative slope. -Graves

### <a name="graphicalmodels">Graphical Models</a>
An undirected graphical model is another name for a [Bayesian net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network), which represents the probabilistic relationships between the variables represented by its nodes.

### <a name="loglikelihood">Log-Likelihood</a>
Log likelihood is related to the statistical idea of the [likelihood function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Log-likelihood). Likelihood is a function of the parameters of a statistical model. "The probability of some observed outcomes given a set of parameter values is referred to as the [likelihood](https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Likelihood_function.html) of the set of parameter values given the observed outcomes."

### <a name="momentum">Momentum</a>
Momentum also known as Nesterovâ€™s momentum, influences the speed of learning. It causes the model to converge faster to a point of minimal error. Momentum adjusts the size of the next step, the weight update, based on the previous stepâ€™s gradient. That is, it takes the gradientâ€™s history and multiplies it. Before each new step, a provisional gradient is calculated by taking partial derivatives from the model, and the hyperparameters are applied to it to produce a new gradient. Momentum influences the gradient your model uses for the next step.

### <a name="nonlineartransformfunction">Nonlinear Transform Function</a>  
A function that maps input on a nonlinear scale such as [sigmoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) or [tanh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function). By definition, a nonlinear function's output is not directly proportional to its input.

###<a name="normalization">Normalization</a> 
The process of transforming the data to span a range from 0 to 1. 

###<a name="objectivefunction">Objective Function</a> 
Also called a Loss Function. An objective function is a heuristic function for reducing prediction error in a machine-learning algorithm.

###<a name="hot">One-Hot Encoding</a> 
Used in classification and bag of words. The label for each example is all 0s, except for a 1 at the index of the actual class to which the example belongs. For BOW, the one represents the word encountered. 

###<a name="reconstructionentropy">Reconstruction Entropy</a> 
After applying Gaussian noise, a kind of statistical white noise, to the data, this [objective function](#objectivefunction) punishes the network for any result that is not closer to the original input. That signal prompts the network to learn different features in an attempt to reconstruct the input better and minimize error. 

###<a name="recurrent">Recurrent Neural Networks</a> 
While "a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can only map from input to output vectors, whereas an RNN can in principle map from the entire history of previous inputs to each output. Indeed, the equivalent result to the universal approximation theory for MLPs is that an RNN with a sufficient number of hidden units can approximate any measurable sequenceto-sequence mapping to arbitrary accuracy (Hammer, 2000). The key point is that the recurrent connections allow a â€˜memoryâ€™ of previous inputs to persist in the networkâ€™s internal state, which can then be used to influence the network output. The forward pass of an RNN is the same as that of an MLP with a single hidden layer, except that activations arrive at the hidden layer from both the current external input and the hidden layer activations one step back in time. " -Graves

###<a name="representation">Representation Learning</a> 

Representation learning is learning the best representation of input. A vector, for example, can "represent" an image. Training a neural network will adjust the vector's elements to represent the image better, or lead to better guesses when a neural network is fed the image. The neural net might train to guess the image's name, for instance. Deep learning means that several layers of representations are stacked atop one another, and those representations are increasingly abstract; i.e. the initial, low-level representations are granular, and may represent pixels, while the higher representations will stand for combinations of pixels, and then combinations of combinations, and so forth. 

###<a name="serialization">Serialization</a> 
Serialization is how you translate data structures or object state into storable formats. DL4J's nets are serialized, which means they can operate on devices with limited memory.

###<a name="skipgram">Skipgram</a> 
The prerequisite to a definition of skipgrams is one of ngrams. [An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) A unigram represents one "item," a bigram two, a trigram three and so forth. Skipgrams are ngrams in which the items are not necessarily contiguous. This can be illustrated best with [a few examples.](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ballison/pdf/lrec_skipgrams.pdf) Skipping is a form of noise, in the sense of [noising and denoising](http://deeplearning4j.org/stackeddenoisingautoencoder.html), which allows neural nets to better generalize their extraction of features. See how skipgrams are implemented in [Word2vec](../word2vec.html).

### <a name="stochasticgradientdescent">Stochastic Gradient Descent</a>
[Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) optimizes gradient descent and minimizes the loss function during network training. 

*Stochastic* is simply a synonym for "random." A stochastic process is a process that involves a random variable, such as randomly initialized weights. Stochastic derives from the Greek word stochazesthai, to guess or aim at. Stochastic processes describe the evolution of, say, a random set of variables, and as such, they involve some indeterminacy -- quite the opposite of having a precisely predicted processes that are deterministic, and have just one outcome. 

The stochastic element of a learning process is a form of search. Random weights represent a hypothesis, an attempt, or a guess that one tests. The results of that search are recorded in the form of a weight adjustment, which effectively shrinks the search space as the parameters move toward a position of less error.  

### <a name="svm">Support Vector Machine</a>

While support-vector machines are not neural networks, they are an important algorithm that [deserves explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15zrpp/please_explain_support_vector_machines_svm_like_i/): 

    An SVM is just trying to draw a line through your training points. So it's just like regular old linear regression except for the following three details: (1) there is an epsilon parameter that means "If the line fits a point to within epsilon then that's good enough; stop trying to fit it and worry about fitting other points." (2) there is a C parameter and the smaller you make it the more you are telling it to find "non-wiggly lines". So if you run SVR and get some crazy wiggly output that's obviously not right you can often make C smaller and it will stop being crazy. And finally (3) when there are outliers (e.g. bad points that will never fit your line) in your data they will only mess up your result a little bit. This is because SVR only gets upset about outliers in proportion to how far away they are from the line it wants to fit. This is contrasted with normal linear regression which gets upset in proportion to the square of the distance from the line. Regular linear regression worries too much about these bad points. TL;DR: SVR is trying to draw a line that gets within epsilon of all the points. Some points are bad and can't be made to get within epsilon and SVR doesn't get too upset about them whereas other regression methods flip out.

### <a name="tensors">Tensors</a>

Here is an example of tensor along dimension (TAD):

![Alt text](../img/tensorAlongDimension.png)

### <a name="vectors">Vector</a>

[Word2vec](../word2vec.html) and other neural networks represent input as vectors.

A vector is a data structure with at least two components, as opposed to a *scalar*, which has just one. For example, a vector can represent velocity, an idea that combines speed and direction: *wind velocity* = (50mph, 35 degrees North East). A scalar, on the other hand, can represent something with one value like temperature or height: 50 degrees Celsius, 180 centimeters.

Therefore, we can represent two-dimensional vectors as arrows on an x-y graph, with the coordinates x and y each representing one of the vector's values. 

![Alt text](../img/vector.jpeg)

Two vectors can relate to one another mathematically, and similarities between them (and therefore between anything you can vectorize, including words) can be measured with precision. 

![Alt text](../img/two_vectors2.png)

As you can see, these vectors differ from one another in both their length, or magnitude, and in their angle, or direction. The angle is what concerns us here. 

### <a name="xavier">Xavier Initialization</a>

The Xavier initialization is based on the work of Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio in their paper "[Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf)." An explanation can be found [here](http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/110998971763/an-explanation-of-xavier-initialization). Weights should be initialized in a way that promotes "learning". The wrong weight initialization will make gradients too large or too small, and make it difficult to update the weights. Small weights lead to small activations, and large weights lead to large ones. Xavier weight initialization considers the distribution of output activations with regard to input activations. Its purpose is to maintain same distribution of activations, so they aren't too small (mean zero but with small variance) or too large (mean zero but with large variance). There are different ways to achieve this. For DL4J's 'xavier' weight initialization, weights are initialized using Gaussian/normal `N(0,1/(nOut+nIn))` distribution, where N(a,b) is a normal distribution with mean a, variance b. That is, weights are sampled from a distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of `1/(nOut+nIn)`. `nOut` and `nIn` are the size of the current layer and previous layer, respectively. Caffe uses `1/nIn`. The original Glorot/Bengio paper uses `2/(nIn+nOut)`.
