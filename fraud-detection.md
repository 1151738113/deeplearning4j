# Fraud and Anomaly Detection With Deep Learning

*(This page is a work in progress.)*

One of the chief uses of deep learning by enterprise is fraud and anomaly detection. 

Anomaly detection is a term referring to a broader set up unusual activities that may include network security breaches or even mechanical breakdowns. Any behavior that be digitized or measured numerically, including machine performance, is subject to anomaly detection. 

Fraud detection is a flagship example of anomaly detection for many reasons, the first being that it is incredibly costly.
