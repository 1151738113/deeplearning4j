# mnist

The MNIST database is a large set of handwritten digits that are used to train neural networks and other algorithms in image recognition. MNIST has 60,000 images in its training set and 10,000 in its test set. 

MNIST derives from NIST, and stands for “Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology.” The MNIST database reshuffles the NIST database's thousands of binary images of handwritten digits in order to better train and test various image recognition techniques. A full explanation of why MNIST is preferable to NIST can be found on [Yann LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Each image in the MNIST database is a 28x28 pixel cell, and each cell is contained within a bounding box, four lines of pixels to frame it. The image is centered according to the center of mass of its pixels. 

MNIST is a good place to begin exploring image recognition. Here’s an easy way to load the data and get started.
