# custom data sets 

Deep learning, and machine learning more generally, needs a good training set to work properly. Collecting and constructing the training set -- a sizable body of known data -- takes time, domain-specific knowledge of where and how to gather relevant information. The training set acts as the benchmark against which deep-learning nets are trained. That is what they learn to reconstruct when they are eventually unleashed on unstructured data. 

At this stage, lengthy human intervention is necessary, both for feature creation and extraction, and simply for pointing the machines in the right direction when they start gathering images, text or other data points. Building a training set is, in a sense, pre-pre-training. 

Training sets that require much time or expertise can serve as a proprietary edge in the competitive world of data science and problem solving. The nature of the expertise is largely in telling your algorithm what matters to you through the training set. It involves telling a story -- through the features you select -- that will guide your deep-learning nets as they extrapolate to other significant features, both in the training set and in the unstructured data they've been created to study.

To create a useful training set, you have to understand the problem you're solving; i.e. what you want your deep-learning nets to pay attention to. 

All input to the deep-learning nets -- whether it's words, images or other data -- must be transformed into numbers known as vectors, in a process called vectorization. A vector is simply a one-column matrix with an extendible number of rows.
