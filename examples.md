# use cases

### named-entity recognition

One use of deep-learning networks is [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition), which is a way to extract from unstructured, unlabeled data certain types of information like people, places, companies or things. That information can then be stored in a structured schema to build, say, a list of addresses or serve as a benchmark for an identity validation engine. 

### object recognition

Object recognition is an algorithm's ability to identify arbitrary objects - such as balls, animals, or even faces - within larger images. This is typically used in engineering applications to identify shapes for modeling purposes. It's also used by social networks for photo tagging. Facebook's Deep Face is a good example of a deep-learning application in this realm. 

Here's an example of faces clustered by a neural net:

### speech to text

With the proper data transforms, a deep network is capable of understanding audio signals. This can be used to identify snippets of sound in larger audio files.

### machine vision + natural-language processing

Advances in [reality capture and reality computing](http://pando.com/2014/02/16/convergence-what-happens-when-virtual-realities-take-over/) are making virtual and real worlds converge. One application of deep learning to this newly available data is to recognize and label objects in 3D environments, and in real life. 

From there, it's a short step to simulated semantics, in which machines learn the nature and constraints of objects in the world, through their virtual representations, and then bring that understanding to the language they generate and ingest. We believe that is one of many futures in store for neural nets. 

To jointly distribute deep learning over images and symbols, a complex of deep learning nets is foreseeable, in which one "manager" net relies on a large number of "expert" nets, each one specialized in one type of pattern recognition: cat faces, table legs, street signs, etc.
