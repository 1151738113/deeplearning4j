## named-entity recognition

One use of deep-learning networks is [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition), which is a way to extract from unstructured, unlabeled data certain types of information like people, places, companies or things. That information can then be stored in a structured schema to build, say, a list of addresses or serve as a benchmark for an identity validation engine. 

## object recognition

Object recognition is an algorithm's ability to identify arbitrary objects - such as balls, animals, or even faces - within larger images. This is typically used in engineering applications to identify shapes for modeling purposes. It's also used by social networks for photo tagging. Facebook's Deep Face is a good example of a deep-learning application in this realm. 

Here's an example of faces clustered by a neural net:

## speech to text

With the proper data transforms, a deep network is capable of understanding audio signals. This can be used to identify snippets of sound in larger audio files.
