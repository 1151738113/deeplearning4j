# data's mathematical representations

Neural nets, and computers in general, only perceive the world as it is processed through mathematical transformations. Math is their seeing-eye dog. Unlike humans, they require data to be transformed into numeric representations before they can work with it. Deeplearning4j utilizes a number of built-in mathematical functions to manipulate and represent data; i.e. to make it workable. 

### normalization

### fourrier transforms
signal processing.

### tensors
Tensors are a way of representing data as n-dimensional matrices. 

### word2vec

we support the ability to create word vectors.

### pandas dataframe

[Pandas dataframe](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13.1/index.html) is a Python data analysis toolkit.
