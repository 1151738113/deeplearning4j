# about us

The best things in life are free. Deeplearning4j is an open-source project spearheaded by the people at [BLIX](blix.io), a San Francisco-based article analytics firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists and semi-sentient robots. 

Everyone's heard of big data. By releasing these tools, we hope to usher business into an era of smart data, which is why we chose to implement them in Java. By using these tools, data scientists can begin to see the power of the deep-learning algorithms already employed by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu and Netflix, all of which have dedicated deep-learning teams.

These algorithms are capable of unsupervised learning that removes the brunt of menial feature extraction from data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on more interesting work.
