# About us

Deeplearning4j is an open-source, distributed deep-learning project in Java spearheaded by the people at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io), a San Francisco-based business intelligence and enterprise software firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists, Java programmers and semi-sentient robots. 

Everyone's heard of big data. By releasing these open-source deep-learning tools, we hope to usher business into an era of smart data, which is why we chose to implement them in Java. By using these tools, data scientists can begin to see the power of the deep-learning algorithms already employed by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu and Netflix, all of which have dedicated deep-learning teams. 

These deep-learning algorithms are capable of unsupervised learning that removes the brunt of menial feature extraction from data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on more interesting work. More generally, we believe they will help us create a safer, smarter, more transparent and more efficient society. 

There are a lot of knobs to turn when you're training a distributed deep-learning network. We've done our best to explain them, so that Deeplearning4j can serve as a DIY tool for Java, Scala and Clojure programmers working on Hadoop and other file systems. If you require support or customization beyond these tutorials, please contact us at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io/contact.html). 

Deeplearning4j has been featured in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/skymind-deep-learning/), [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/02/a-startup-called-skymind-launches-pushing-open-source-deep-learning/), [Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-03/teaching-smaller-companies-how-to-probe-deep-learning-on-their-own), [Venturebeat](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/skymind-launches-with-open-source-plug-and-play-deep-learning-features-for-your-app/) and [The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/06/03/the-morning-download-apple-relies-on-ecosystem-for-innovation/). DL4J workshops are offered through [GalvanizeU](http://www.galvanizeu.com/) in San Francisco.

[ND4J is the scientific computing engine](http://nd4j.org/) powering our matrix manipulations. (See its [Github repo here](https://github.com/SkymindIO/nd4j/).)
