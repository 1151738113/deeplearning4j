# about us

Deeplearning4j is an open-source project spearheaded by the people at [BLIX](blix.io), a San Francisco-based article analytics firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists and writers. 

Everyone's heard of big data. By releasing these tools, we hope to usher business into an era of smart data. Which is why we chose to implement them in Java. 

Algorithms are capable of unsupervised learning that removes the brunt of menial feature extraction from data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on more interesting work. 

The best things in life are free.
